Welcome to the Place Queen Game! The objective of the game is to strategically place queens on a chessboard such that each queen is in a unique region, and no two queens can attack each other. This means there should be only one queen per row, column, and diagonal.

2. The game board will be displayed. Click on a cell to place a queen.

3. Ensure that each queen is placed such that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

4. Continue placing queens until all regions have exactly one queen.

## Rules

- **One Queen per Region**: Each region must have exactly one queen.
- **No Attacks**: Queens should be placed so that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

## Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Think several moves ahead to ensure that you don't run out of spaces for queens.
- **Use All Regions**: Make sure you are utilizing all regions on the board to place the queens effectively.

## Example

Here is an example of a valid configuration on an 8x8 chessboard:

```
. Q . . . . . .
. . . Q . . . .
. . . . . Q . .
. . . . . . . Q
Q . . . . . . .
. . Q . . . . .
. . . . Q . . .
. . . . . . Q .
```

In this configuration, each queen is placed such that no two queens can attack each other.
